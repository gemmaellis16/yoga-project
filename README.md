## **Project Aim**

Welcome to Gemma Ellis Yoga website. This yoga studio is located in the heart of a valley in North Wales and a perfect location to feel the benefits of what yoga has to offer - a beautiful stretch, some lovely breathing techniques and a peaceful relaxation to finish. On this site I hope you will be able to easily navigate the information about the studio and teacher and also able to access it on mobile, tablet and desktop.

### **Design**

#### * **Colour Scheme**

 * The main colour is a pink/peach colour (rgba(235, 131, 46, 0.548)) for the background, footer is rgba(236, 151, 93, 0.6), tables and text boxes are rgba(245, 94, 24, 0.582).
 The idea is that the colours compliment the main image on the homepage to give the user a feeling of warmth and a relaxed feel typically like you would feel in a yoga class.
    

#### * **Typography**

* The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the website with Exo as the fallback font in case the font isn't imported correctly to the site. The Roboto font is used frequently in programming.

#### * **Imagery**

* The large yoga image on the homepage is designed to be calming and dreamy to give the users the sense that when they attend the studio they will feel relaxed and ultimately want to browse the website further to book a class.

#### **Testing User Stories from User Experience**

* First Time Visitor Goals

1. As a first time visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the studio.

    1. When entering the site users will see a readible navigation bar to get to the page of their choice. Even when they are on a specific page they can press the 'Gemma Ellis Yoga' logo to return to the main page.

    1. On the contact us page after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the information dissappears (could link to an actual email account with a Thank you message).

    1. On the about page I want to clearly locate the 'New student registration form' to fill it out and bring with me to the first session. 

1. As a first time visitor, I am curious to know more about the owner/studio

    1. On the homepage users can scroll down and see student testimonials and be clear that the studio is a friendly environment with a good teacher.

    1. Clearly labelled 'About' page on navigation bar.

    1. The 'About' page contains a photo of the teacher and short paragraph about her experience.  

1. As a first time visitor, I want to view the studio and student/teachers gallery to view the environment so I can decide if it's the class I'd like to participate in. 

    1. In the navigation bar there is a clearly labelled 'Gallery' page with images of inside the studio, with students and outside of the studio. 

* Returning Visitor Goals

1. As a returning visitor, I want to find the best way to get into contact with the studio with any questions I may have. 

    1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the 'Contact page'.

    1. Here, they can fill out the form on the page (but I have not linked it to anything as this out of the scope of the MS1 project).

    1. There is also the direct phone number or email of the studio (fictional).

    1. The footer contains links to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram (to the main pages of the social media homepages and not to the teachers own account due to privacy purposes).

1. As a returning visitor, I want to find out the membership options

    1. In the classes page 'prices' are clearly labelled for the visitor to view.

## **Features**

 * Responsive on all device sizes.

 * Interactive elements.

### **Existing Features**

### **Navigation**

For the navigation bar I have used Boostrap to create a responsive navbar as well as the hamburger icon for mobile devices to be more user-friendly. 

### **Main Image**

The main image is of a yoga pose on the beach during sunset from the website Splash. It creates a warm, calming feeling. The yoga pose is a simple pose that all abilities can perfrom so wouldn't put off any beginners or unconfident students.

### **Cover Text**

The main idea to put cover text over the image was to grab the user attention immediately - one box is to get them to book a session straight away or to have that in thier minds immediately and the second box is to explain the definition of yoga so that a beginner understands the purpose.

### **Benefits**

This idea was taken from the Love Running project - as its simple and eye catching for the user - with short explanations of what the benefits of yoga are to a beginner or even to remind the experienced yoga students. It is in three columns (taken from Bootstrap) to appear neat and tidy on the page with easily identifiable Font awesome icons to attract the user. 

### **Testimonials**

I also used  the grid from bootstrap and as also some icons to make the section more visually appealing with images from my own collection and different names for the people in the images (I have consent of these people).

### **About Section**

I used an example layout from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_about_page.asp/ to create the about section to introduce the user to the teacher. With the same image layout that was used in the testimonials section for consistency over the pages.

I added an information/etiquette/tips section because as a new student to yoga they may feel uncomfortable entering a studio without any prior knowledeg of what to bring and of what to expect ect so this may help those that are unconfident accessing the studio alone. 

In addition I added two downloadable links on this page, one of a sample relaxation script which had audio and the second of a student registration form that would be required upon visiting the studio for the first time. Again I added fontawesome icons to the headers to be more appealing.

### **Gallery**

I wanted three columns and three rows of images so it would be appealing to the eye on desktop view and then down to two columns in mobile view so that images didn't appear stretched or pixlated. I did originally put in the wireframes that I wanted one column in the mobile view but this wouldn't appear balanced in my opinion. I also added an extra image to appear in mobile view so that there would be 10 images (5 in each column) to appear balanced (balance is at the heart of yoga so I wanted the website to appear balanced as much as possible throughout).

### **Classes**

This is the most simple page of them all - with three simple tables to look at the class timetable, simple descriptions of the classes and then the price options. It is important to have different price options as this may attract more students. 

### **Contact**

At the top of the page I placed the form so that it would catch the attention of the users if they had any questions for the teacher. They then have to scroll down for the contact details and the map of the location. 

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### **Features to be implemented**

* When submitting the form, the information should be sent to the yoga studio email account.
* Chat bot that can assist the user.
* Interactive map for the location with a link to google maps.
* Include information on how their data will be used (GDPR-Law).
* Yoga videos for those that can not attend class.  


### **Further Testing**

* The website was tested on Google Chrome and Safari browsers.

* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as desktop, laptop, tablet and iphone. 

* A large amount of testing was conducted to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.

* Friends were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs/user experience.

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### * **Navigation bar**

* Idea
I wanted to ensure that the navigation bar was working accordingly at the top of the page and when clicked on, the navigation links would take the user to the page of their choice. For simple and attractive purposes the navigation bar would then convert to a hamburger icon with a dropdown menu on mobile devices.

* Utilization
I implemented the navigation bar using Bootstrap, which ensured an effective overall structure and lay out to the navbar. CSS was used to overwrite the default settings and made the navbar in line with the overall webite. I also used Bootstrap to implement the hamburger sign for mobile devices.

* Test
To test the navigation bar, I clicked all the links to make sure it worked properly. I have also opened the website in various browers (safari, google chrome, mozilla firefox) to make sure it worked on all browsers and devices. On mobile the navigation transformed into the hamburger sign with a dropdown menu.

* Result
The navigation bar appears how I would have expected it on all browsers and devices. However on the index page (main page) while on mobile device the dropdown does not appear as it is as it's blurred by the text-cover box. - So I have to hide the cover box in mobile display in order to see the dropdown menu.

* Verdict
The test has passed all the criteria and works like planned.

### Modal
* Plan
I wanted to use a modal that would allow the user to book on the main page (a place were it's clearly visible and easy to get to for a returning user).

* Utilisation
I used Bootstrap to include the modals on the website and this was positioned to the left of the box as the text was also aligned left. I used the same colours as I did on my contact us form to keep consistency throughout the pages. 

* Test
Initially the modal worked succesfully however the next day it didn't work. So every effort was used to check the problem.

* Result
The modal opened up when the Book now button was clicked and appeared on screen.

* Verdict
The modal works as planned.

### Audio

* Plan
I wanted to use audio as a taster for users of what to expect when in the relaxation during a class. This would allow the user to determine if they would like to hear more by coming to a session.  

* Utilisation
I used an iphone recording device called 'voice memos' to record the audio and used one of the relaxation scripts I used during my classses in the past. To ensure they didn't miss this it was in the about section (to learn more about the classes) and I provided a clear download icon so that the user would know where to click.

* Test
The audio worked succesfully on the first test.

* Result
The audio opened up when the Download button was clicked and appeared on screen.

* Verdict
The audio works as planned.

### Student Registration Form

* Plan
I wanted to enable the users to download and fill in the student registration form (if they would prefer) before the session so there is no rush at the beginning of the session. This is important for the teacher to have as it gives the teacher an idea of any health issues so that the teacher would be able to adapt the sessions/poses for the individual. 

* Utilisation
I copied a student reg template I used in the past to a folder and again to keep it consistent with the audio link put a download icon next to it so that they could download the page. 

* Test
The file worked succesfully on the first test, 

* Result
The audio opened up when the Download button was clicked and appeared on screen.

* Verdict
The audio works as planned.

### Contact Form

* Plan
I want to include a contact form so that the user can contact the studio/teacher with any queries they have (even to book through this too). On the form they can enter their name, email address and write a message. I also ensured they had to fill in the fields before submitting the button. 

* Utilization
To create this, I made a contact page and placed the form at the top of the page. There were two fields for the name and email address then a textarea field for the message and a submit button. I also ensured the form was the same colour as the rest of the pages for consistency.

* Test
When I tested the form, I realised that nothing opened up and there was nothing to indicate to the user that the form was submitted. This meant it was not user friendly, so if I had more experience I would have liked to include JS to implement this.

* Result
After implementing the modal the form worked as planned and provided the correct feedback to the user.

* Verdict
The form worked but without the modal.
