            <h2>Gemma Ellis</h2>
            <p class="title">Teacher</p>
        <p>A British Wheel of Yoga Teacher. I have been practicing yoga for over 15 years. My practice has helped me grow stronger and more flexible, both on and off the mat. With a background in sports, fitness and education, I want students to have the confidence to bring balance in their lives. 
            My aim is to create a comfortable environment for students to develop a connection with their bodies.  It is a non competitive class with the focus on them as individuals. I also want students to strengthen muscles, improve flexibility and overall have an enhanced feeling of well-being.

            <h2>Tips</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>What to wear: Please wear close-fitting and comfortable attire.</li>
                <li>What to bring: Bring a bottle of water and mat. Please bring a blanket for the relaxation. Please complete a New Client Form before your first class.</li>
                <li>What to expect: Classes will start with breath awareness. Then progress onto traditional yoga asanas, finishing with a relaxation.</li>
                <li>Food and drink: Please avoid eating a heavy meal 1 hour before class.</li>
                <li>Keep up to date: Please check my Facebook page ‘Gemma Claire’ for class time tables.</li>

                <h2>Information</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Let me know on a weekly basis if your health changes</li>
                    <li>Focus on your breath. Allow your breath to be slow and controlled throughout the practise, the inhalation and exhalation should be the same length.</li>
                    <li>Child's pose is always an option during the session. This is a great resting pose and will help you to relax.</li>
                    <li>Please do not get focused on just being flexible. “Yoga is not about touching your toes, it’s about what you learn on the way down”.</li>
